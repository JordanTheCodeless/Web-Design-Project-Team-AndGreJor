                    Solar energy stands out as the most abundant among all renewable resources. Its harnessing capabilities are not limited to sunny days; even in cloudy weather, solar technologies can deliver heat, cooling, natural lighting, electricity, and fuels. The rate at which the Earth intercepts solar energy is about 10,000 times greater than humanity's energy consumption rate. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although solar resource distribution varies globally, every country can make a significant contribution to its energy mix through direct solar energy. The cost of manufacturing solar panels has seen a substantial decrease in the past decade, rendering them not only affordable but often the cheapest source of electricity. With a lifespan of approximately 30 years, solar panels come in various shades, reflecting the diverse materials used in their manufacturing.
